# Light-Dark-Mode
This file will teach us how to turn Light Mode -> Dark Mode and reverse. Later on we will add a few changes such as API Calling, image changing, new features as well and implementations in real worlds webpages


This project showcases a simple webpage that allows users to toggle between light and dark themes. The page includes a header with a button for toggling the theme, a section to display content, and interactive buttons that change style based on the current theme. It uses **CSS Custom Properties (CSS Variables)** to manage the color themes dynamically.

## Features

- **Light and Dark Mode Toggle**: Users can easily switch between a light and dark theme using an intuitive button in the top right corner.
