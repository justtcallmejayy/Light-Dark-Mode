# Light-Dark-Mode
This file will teach us how to turn Light Mode -> Dark Mode and reverse. Later on we will add a few changes such as API Calling, image changing, new features as well and implementations in real worlds webpages


This project showcases a simple webpage that allows users to toggle between light and dark themes. The page includes a header with a button for toggling the theme, a section to display content, and interactive buttons that change style based on the current theme. It uses **CSS Custom Properties (CSS Variables)** to manage the color themes dynamically.

## Features

- **Light and Dark Mode Toggle**: Users can easily switch between a light and dark theme using an intuitive button in the top right corner.
- **Responsive Design**: The webpage layout adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Smooth Theme Transitions**: Switching between themes is visually smooth and consistent.

<!-- I'd be happy to review your LinkedIn summary for the footer! It’s a good idea to include a LinkedIn summary or similar content in the footer if you want to add a personal touch and make your webpage feel more professional. A footer often includes concise, essential information like contact details, links to social profiles, and other resources, so we can certainly incorporate your LinkedIn summary.

If you provide me with your LinkedIn summary, I can help structure it to ensure it's concise and looks professional in the footer.

You may also want to include other key elements such as:
- **Your name/brand** (if not already included elsewhere on the page)
- **Social media links** (LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, etc.)
- **Email/contact** (if you want visitors to be able to contact you directly)
- **Additional links** (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, etc.)

Let me know if you’d like any help with organizing or formatting the LinkedIn summary for the footer, or if you’d like to provide more information! -->
